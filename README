Building
========

ConfHUD requires the following libraries to compile:

    SDL 1.2 (libsdl1.2-dev)
    SDL Image 1.2 (libsdl-image1.2-dev)
    PCRE3 (libpcre3-dev)
    FTGL 2.1.3~rc5-2 (libftgl-dev)
    PNG library (libpng12-dev)
    JPEG library (libjpeg62-dev)

Additionally, confhud has scripts that use the following packages;

    libwww-perl
    graphicsmagick

You will also need an old copy of the Gource source tarball
compatible with ConfHUD (0.23 is known to work).

Building on Linux:

    ./configure
    make

Installation:

    make install
    scripts/confhud-config config/example

Will install the example config from the config/example sub directory.
